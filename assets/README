evcouplings_example_data_1

Files:
  (1) 1fqg.pdb
      an example structure of beta lactamase on which we are experimenting in the lab
      
  (2) blanat_CouplingScoresCompared.tab
      a tab delimited file with each row containing residue-residue predicted contact
      scores and actual 3d distances.
        column 1: index of residue 1
        column 2: index of residue 1
        column 3: predicted coupling score (higher means more likely residues are in contact)
        column 4: distance between residues in 3d structure
