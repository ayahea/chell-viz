CouplingScoresCompared_all.csv (black dots)
	- Row i
	- Row j
	- Row cn = EC score
	- Row probability (filter to be > .99, but user should be able to define on the fly)

Careful: ignore probabilities for amino acids that are in a neighborhood of 5 from currently considered amino acid ( -------{nn[P]nn}------- // {[P]nn}-------------- // --------------{nn[P]} ==> ignore n's)




distance_map_monomer.csv
	- Ignore first row
	- Second row: position
	- Third row: Secondary structure (one letter = one status)

See in PDFs: some start at position 1, some at higher position. Secondary structure is drawn in black on right side of the contact map




contacts_monomer.csv (blue dots)
